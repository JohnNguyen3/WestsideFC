          <section class="ReportContent">
            <p>#2 Westside FC, continues their dominant run in the playoffs with a commanding 3-0 victory over #6 Small Goals Big Hearts, securing their second SGS Division 3 Finals appearance.</p>
            <p>Led by the red-hot form of John W, who now boasts a record-breaking six goals and one assist in the playoffs, #2 Westside FC extended their clean sheet streak to four games and their overall win streak to five. Their MVP goalkeeper, Kaz, once again demonstrated why #2 Westside FC has the top-rated defense in the league, completely stifling #6 Small Goals Big Hearts’ offense.</p>
            <p>Playing without their star player Joe, #6 Small Goals Big Hearts struggled to mount any serious attacking threats, leaving a noticeable void in their game plan.</p>
            <p>John W wasted no time asserting his influence, netting the first goal of the match in the 3rd minute after stealing the ball from a defender and slotting it home to give #2 Westside FC an early 1-0 lead.</p>
            <p>In the 6th minute, a quick out-of-bounds play from Travie down the right sideline led to a spectacular backheel pass from Niko to John W, who calmly finished the play to double #2 Westside FC’s lead to 2-0.</p>
            <p>#2 Westside FC would continue to put the game out of reach with an 8th-minute goal from Baki, assisted by John W, to make it 3-0. From that point, #6 Small Goals Big Hearts couldn’t recover, as they struggled to create scoring opportunities against a suffocating #2 Westside FC defense.</p>
            <p>Kaz and the #2 Westside backline held firm throughout, ensuring a shutout and securing the team’s sixth consecutive victory over #6 Small Goals Big Hearts, bringing their all-time record to 6-0-3.</p>
